Small money-transferring application API

Remember to _docker login_ before trying any **Docker** related operation!

If you have never used a **Docker** based environment before, your first step would be likely to execute the command `docker swarm init`. This will allow your physical computer to act as the manager node of an orquested swarm.

Only then you will be able to execute the main script. Make sure your environmental variables are correct inside the _deployment_script.sh_ file, and then execute it. It will create all the necessary and deploy the API server on the 8000 port.

After that, you will have the application ready to recept any requests!
